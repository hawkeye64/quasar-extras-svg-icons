Interested in contributing to quasar-extras-svg-icons? Here's how you can contribute:

## Introduction

quasar-extras-svg-icons is free to use (MIT License) for anybody building a web-based product or website. The quasar-extras-svg-icons community is working to make it better. Contributors like ++you++ help make quasar-extras-svg-icons great! We are happy to see you here.

Contributions are not limited to code. We also encourage feedback, documentation, new design, and tools. And, we also encourage [sponsorship](/contributing/sponsor), especially if you are using quasar-extras-svg-icons in a business endeavor.

All you need is a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join) to get started.

## Working in the open

quasar-extras-svg-icons lives on [GitHub](https://github.com/hawkeye64/quasar-extras-svg-icons). All work, discussion, issues, bugs, features, improvements, and comments happen right out in the open where everyone can see.

If you’re looking for something that we don’t have, or you notice something could be improved, you have two options:

1. Open an issue for the request. We’ll review the issue and get back to you with next steps. If we decide the request should be part of our pipeline, we’ll add it to our roadmap. There are never timeline guarantees for requests, but we’ll do our best to give you an estimate.

2. Begin the work yourself and contribute it back to quasar-extras-svg-icons. We appreciate completed contributions but also works-in-progress. You’re welcome to open an issue to surface your work and we’ll weigh in and help where we can.

Regardless of how you choose to contribute, we encourage you to open an issue as early as possible in the process.

## Design

You do not have to be a developer to contribute to quasar-extras-svg-icons. You can also design one and either core developers will work on it or the community will get involved.

## Parts of a component contribution

Component contributions ideally include all of the following parts.

1. **A rationale**
   Explain how your component will add value to the system. quasar-extras-svg-icons serves the widest possible range of products, and contributions that increase the scope of the system are more likely to be accepted. Be sure to include any user experience and interaction descriptions.

2. **A design spec**
   Create sizing and styling annotations for all aspects of the component. This spec should provide a developer with everything they need to create the design in code.

3. **Code documentation**
   We recommend reading through existing code documentation on this site for inspiration.

## First steps to contributing

To contribute a component to quasar-extras-svg-icons, start by opening a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/hawkeye64/quasar-extras-svg-icons/issues). Include a detailed description in which you:

- Explain the rationale
- Detail the intended behavior
- Clarify whether it’s a variation of an existing component, or a new asset
- Include mockups of any fidelity (optional)
- Include any inspirations from other products (optional)

This issue will be the staging ground for the contribution and an opportunity for the community to weigh in with any suggestions. We encourage you to surface work in progress. Someone in the community may be working on the same component and interested in collaborating with you.
